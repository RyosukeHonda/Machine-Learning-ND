\subsection{Problem Statement}
The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made.







{\Large The CIFAR-10 dataset}\\
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32x3(width=height=32 and RGB=3) color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images. 50,000 images are the training images and 10,000 images are the test images.\\
The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap within each image class.

In this task, I'll discuss the image recognition by Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
