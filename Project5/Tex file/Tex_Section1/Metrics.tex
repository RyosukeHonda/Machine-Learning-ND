\subsection{Metrics}
%Metrics used to measure performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics aper classre justified based on the characteristics of the problem.


The objective in this problem is multi class classification. Therefore,the metrics will be accuracy score. 
In the deep learning algorithms, the predicted output is probability. The probability is defined as the softmax as shown below.

\begin{eqnarray}
p_{j}=\frac{e^{u_{j}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}e^{u_{k}}}
\end{eqnarray}

The probability is calculated by each class and then the highest probability is the predicted output. In this task, the accuracy score is calculated by the following formula.

 \begin{eqnarray}
Accuracy  \ Score =\frac{Number \ of\  correctly\  classified\ output}{Number\ of\ the\ data}
\end{eqnarray}




%Classification Error is calculated by the difference between the optimal output $d_{1},...,d_{n}$ and predicted output$p_{1},...,p_{n}$.
%The target output$d_{1},...,d_{n}$ takes the representation of 1-of-n. That means that only the correct label j becomes $d_{j}=1$ and the others k($\neq$ j) become $d_{k}=0$.
