\subsection{Model Evaluation,Validation and Justification}
The final model’s qualities — such as parameters — are evaluated in detail. Some type of analysis is used to validate the robustness of the model’s solution.

By utilizing the bayesian optimization, I optimized the number of dimensions of first layer of fully connected layer. I got the optimal number which is 417 and the test accuracy is 71.9\%
From the result of Bayesian Optimization, I chose ----- as the final model parameters.
The model improves the accuracy rate by 1.7\%

The training and test accuracy in this model is as follows.
The loss of the model is shown in Fig.--- 





The final results are compared to the benchmark result or threshold with some type of statistical analysis. Justification is made as to whether the final model and solution is significant enough to have adequately solved the problem.




The training and validation loss in the benchmark is Fig---. The counterpart in final result is Fig.---


The number of miss-classified data in benchmark is ----. On the other hand, the number in the final result is ----.The distribution difference in miss-classified data between the benchmark and the final result is following.
