\subsection{Model Evaluation and Validation}
The final model’s qualities — such as parameters — are evaluated in detail. Some type of analysis is used to validate the robustness of the model’s solution.

By utilizing the bayesian optimization, I optimized the number of dimensions of first layer of fully connected layer. I got the optimal number which is 417 and the test accuracy is 71.9\%
From the result of Bayesian Optimization, I chose ----- as the final model parameters.
