\subsection{Implementation}
The process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data has been thoroughly documented. Complications that occurred during the coding process are discussed.


As I introduced in the section2.4(Benchmark), I utilized the 4 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers.In this section, I explain the architecture of the model in more depth.

The objective of the learning is to minimize the cross entropy in the learning process.
The architecture of the model is the following.

As for the optimizer, I utilized 'Adam'.
With this setting, I got the accuracy rate of 70.2\%
