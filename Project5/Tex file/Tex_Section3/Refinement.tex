\subsection{Refinement}
The process of improving upon the algorithms and techniques used is clearly documented. Both the initial and final solutions are reported, along with intermediate solutions, if necessary.

Finding the optimal parameters for deep learning is quite difficult though it is important. When it comes to typical machine learning algorithm(Decision tree, Support Vector Machine etc.),grid search is taken to search the optimal parameters. However, it's almost impossible to apply grid search in deep learning because of the computational time.It has reported that the grid search strategies are inferior to random search.\cite{Random} Therefore, other methods are indispensable. A good choice is Bayesian optimization, which has been shown to outperform other state of the art global optimization algorithms on a number of challenging optimization benchmark functions.
