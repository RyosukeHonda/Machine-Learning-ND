\subsection{Algorithms and Techniques}
%Algorithms and techniques used in the project are thoroughly discussed and properly justified based on the characteristics of the problem.

In this task, I'll use Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). CNN has been successful in  practical applications for image recognition.CNN consists of convolution layer, pooling layer and fully-connected layer and sometimes contains local contrast normalization(LCN). In this chapter, I'll discuss the convolution layer and pooling.
As the name 'convolution' suggests, the network employs a mathematical operation called convolution. 

Fig.5 is the example of the architecture of the CNN.

Pooling layer is put after the convolution layer. %Pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the input image. 
The function of the pooling layer is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting.
By introducing pooling layer, not only the architecture will be more robust but also the dimensionality will be reduced. Max pooling and Average pooling are the typical pooling which are generally utilized. Figure.7 is the example of the pooling.The original map is the size of 4$\times$4. The stride for the pooling is 2 and the pooling size is 2$\times$2. "Max pooling" is to extract the maximum pixel from each region and "Average pooling" is to calculate the average value for each region.In this task, I utilized max pooling at the pooling layers.
