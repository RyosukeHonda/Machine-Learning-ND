\subsection{Data Exploration}
%If a dataset is present, features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed, along with a sampling of the data. In lieu of a dataset, a thorough description of the input space or input data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified.


CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50,000 images of training data and 10,000 images of test data.For each data, it contains 10 different kind of classes(discussed in the next chapter) and the distribution of each class is the same in both training and test data. That means 5,000 images for each class in the training data and 1,000 images for each class in the test data.(Fig.\ref{fig:three} and Fig.4).
